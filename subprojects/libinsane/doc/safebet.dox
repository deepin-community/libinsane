\page safebet Safe bet

Safe bet is the recommended set of LibInsane API implementations.

`lis_safebet()` takes care of putting together base API implementations
and wrappers and return an implementation that should work in all cases.

`lis_safebet()` can be configured through environment variables to disable
(or force enabled) some wrappers. The whole list of variables can easily
be found in the source code (subprojects/libinsane/src/safebet.c).

See \ref safebet.h
