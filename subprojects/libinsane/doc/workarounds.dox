\page workarounds Workarounds

In Libinsane, workarounds are wrappers that wraps another implementation and
change its behaviour to work around bugs (or annoying behaviors really close
to bugs).

For instance, the Sane API on GNU/Linux let the drivers free to do a lot of
things as they want. So inevitably, some do not respect
[usual Sane conventions](http://www.sane-project.org/html/doc014.html).

See \ref workarounds.h.
