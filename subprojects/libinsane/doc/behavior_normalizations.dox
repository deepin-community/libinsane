\page behavior_normalizations Behavior normalizations

Behavior normalizers are wrappers that change some behaviours of the wrapped
implementations. They do *not* work around or fix bugs. The end goal is to
just to make sure the behaviour will be consistent across platforms and
libraries.

For instance, they make sure the default scan area is the biggest scan area
possible. They also make sure in the end we get images as RAW24.

See \ref normalizers.h.
