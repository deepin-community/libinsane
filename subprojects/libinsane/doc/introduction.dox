\page introduction What is Libinsane ?

Libinsane is a library allowing access to image scanners. It is the successor of
[Pyinsane](https://github.com/openpaperwork/pyinsane/)

Its name is a reference to the library [Sane](http://sane-project.org/).


### Image scanners you said ?

Yep, those things:

![Simple flatbed scanner](flatbed.png)
![Multi-functions printer, including a scanner with feeder](flatbed_and_feeder.png)
![Old-school portable scanner](handheld.png)
![New-school portable scanner](portable.png)
![Scanner with only a feeder](adf.png)

Basically, paper eaters. Not webcams, not your smartphone, not USB keys, not
other weird thingies that could acquire or generate images.


### Main features

- Cross-platform: Linux, \*BSD and Windows.
- Cross-API: [Sane](http://sane-project.org/) (Linux, \*BSD),
  [WIA2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms630368(v=vs.85).aspx) (Windows),
  [TWAIN](https://www.twain.org/) (Windows).
- Cross-language: Thanks to [GObject introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection?action=show&redirect=GObjectIntrospection).
- Cross-scanner and cross-driver: Because a lot of them have their own quirks (and sometimes bugs).
- Returns the scanned image as the scan goes (whenever the scanner driver permits it)


### Out of the scope of this library

This library is *not*:

- a GUI library: No GUI component here
- an image manipulation library: The image is returned as RAW24. Converting it,
  saving it and displaying it are your problems.


### Guarantees

Scanners provide many options. Unfortunately, it is impossible to support them
all in Libinsane. While any settings should work with Libinsane, only the
following settings are always guaranteed to work with any scanner on any
platform:

- Any resolution
- Source:
  - Flatbed
  - Automatic Document Feeder
- Scan area set to the maximum size
- Mode:
  - 24 bits colors
  - Grayscale (converted on-the-fly to raw rgb24)
  - Black & white (converted on-the-fly to raw rgb24)
